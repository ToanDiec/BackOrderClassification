# BackOrderClassification
The project is about applying data analysis pipeline from data preparation, modelling, model evaluation and tunning on an unclean dataset that contains information of more than 1 million rows of real data. The data file contains the historical data for the 8 weeks prior to the week we are trying to predict. The data were taken as weekly snapshots at the start of each week. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict went_on_backorder variable based on the given dataset. The project includes step by step of how to prepare the data to a fully running model using python as the main coding language.  Product back order is one of the common issues in supply chain management. Back order simply means that a customer order has not been fulfilled. The issue can raise some potential alert such as demand excess supply, bottle neck in supply chain or strong sale performance. Most of the companies want to avoid back order because it can upset the customer, cancelling order and lead to lower customer loyalty. However, companies also do not want to over stocking, which can add up the inventory cost. To solve this issue, this project will apply machine learning to seek and predict any pattern related to back order before it happens.  Result of this predictive analytics approach can save organizations money and ensure customer will get their order with minimum waiting time.
